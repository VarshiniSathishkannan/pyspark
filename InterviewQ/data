# Event data

purchasing a product - Generates many events
    click events
    order data
    customer data

100's of events, 100's of attributes

# Trend analysis

# Granularity 
    Granularity in data refers to the level of detail or precision of the data. For example, data that has a high level of granularity would have a large number of individual piecees of information, such as individual records of measurement

# Dimensions
    Dimensions are attributes of your data

# Metrics
    Metrics are quantitative measurements

A column with high cardinality has a large number of distinct values while a column with low cardinality has a small number of distinct values

# OLAP

OLAP - Online Analytical Processing

Fast, slice and dice analytics - filtering, grouping and aggregating

drill down - quater to month to days to hours

roll up - opposite of drill down

dice - filtering based on conditions to show only specific dimensions - 3D

pivot - Interchanging rows and columns

# ETL and ELT

schema on write - ETL

schema on read - ELT - Modern approach

# full load:
less volume, no incremental identifiers, example - dimension table, static table, history or one time load, frequency of load is less

# incremental load:
delta load, captures only changes
inserts, updates and deletes
huge volume, incremental identifiers example - fact table or transaction table, frequency of load is more

scheduled vs on demand loading

batch vs stream vs microbatch loading

push vs pull loading 

series vs parallel loading

Flattening of data

Flattening data means transforming nested or hierarchical data structures into a flat, tabular format â€” where each field becomes a separate column.

In simple terms: turning complex JSON/XML into rows and columns.
