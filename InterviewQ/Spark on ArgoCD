Apache Spark is a distributed data processing engine.

ArgoCD is a GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

“Spark on ArgoCD” means you are deploying and managing Spark jobs or clusters on Kubernetes, using ArgoCD to automate and manage the deployment.

Why Use ArgoCD for Spark?
1. ✅ GitOps for Spark
All Spark job definitions (YAMLs, Helm charts, etc.) live in Git.

Any changes (new jobs, updates) are automatically applied to the cluster via ArgoCD.

Version control + rollback = safer data pipelines.

2. ⛵ Spark on Kubernetes
Spark supports running on Kubernetes natively (since Spark 2.3).

You define Spark jobs using SparkApplication CRDs (from Spark Operator).

ArgoCD watches those CRDs and deploys them when changes happen in Git.

3. 🔄 CI/CD for Data Jobs
Imagine your data engineer pushes a new PySpark job to Git.

ArgoCD sees the change and applies it.

Spark Operator creates the job on the Kubernetes cluster.

🎯 Result: fully automated Spark job deployment pipeline.

ArgoCD (Argo Continuous Delivery) is a declarative GitOps tool for Kubernetes. It automatically syncs Kubernetes resources from Git repositories to your cluster.

In simple terms:

💡 “Whatever you define in Git, ArgoCD ensures it’s running in your Kubernetes cluster.”
