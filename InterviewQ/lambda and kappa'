Lambda Architecture:

Lambda Architecture is a data processing architecture designed to handle massive quantities of data by combining batch and real-time (streaming) processing.

Components of Lambda Architecture
It has three main layers:

1. Batch Layer
Stores the master dataset (immutable, append-only data)

Computes batch views using large-scale processing (e.g., Spark, Hadoop)

Handles historical and complete data

🔁 Periodically recomputes the full data view to ensure accuracy

2. Speed Layer (a.k.a. Streaming Layer)
Processes real-time data as it arrives

Provides low-latency updates

Uses systems like Spark Streaming, Flink, Kafka Streams

⚠ Only handles recent data for fast updates

3. Serving Layer
Merges outputs from batch and speed layers

Exposes data through queries, dashboards, APIs

🔎 Final result = Batch View + Real-Time View

✅ Benefits of Lambda Architecture

Feature	Why It Matters
Scalability	Works with large-scale, distributed systems
Fault-tolerant	Batch layer acts as source of truth
Low-latency	Real-time layer enables immediate insights
Accuracy	Batch layer corrects real-time approximations

⚠️ Challenges
Complexity: You need to maintain two code paths (batch & stream)

Code duplication: Same logic needs to be implemented in both layers

Operational overhead: Managing two systems and ensuring consistency

🆚 Modern Alternative: Unified Architectures
Many systems are moving toward Kappa Architecture or Delta Architecture:

🔁 Kappa Architecture
Only uses stream processing

Uses tools like Apache Flink or Kafka Streams

Replay logs for historical computation

🧪 Delta Architecture
Uses Delta Lake (or Apache Hudi/Iceberg)

Combines stream + batch via Structured Streaming

Simplifies pipeline with single code path
