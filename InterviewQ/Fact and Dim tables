Find at the centre of star or snowflake schema and its surrounded by dimension tables. It consists of facts about a particular business process

A surrogate key is a system-generated, unique identifier (usually an integer) used as the primary key in a dimension table.

Enable tracking of historical versions

Simplify joins between fact and dimension tables

🔁 Tracks history	Each version of a record gets a new surrogate key (important for SCD Type 2 and 6)
🔑 Avoids dependency on business keys	Business keys might change (e.g. usernames), or be messy (non-unique, long strings)
⚙️ Faster joins & better performance	Integer joins are more efficient than string-based joins
🚀 Decouples warehouse from source systems	Source system changes won’t break your keys or joins
